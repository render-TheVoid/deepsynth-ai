# DeepSynth

**DeepSynth** is a web-based chatbot powered by a **local LLM** (Ollama Deepseek-R1 1.5B, distilled 4-bit quantized model). It allows users to chat locally with the model and download their conversation logs as JSON. No database is required â€” all data is handled in-memory or exported from the frontend.

---

## Features

- **Local LLM Integration:** Uses `deepseek-r1:1.5b` locally for fast, private inference.  
- **Frontend:** Built with React.js and styled using Tailwind CSS. Handles chat UI and JSON export.  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express.js handles chat messages to the local model.  
- **Downloadable Chat Logs:** Frontend allows exporting conversations as structured JSON files.  
- **Session Metadata:** Each message includes timestamps, roles, and model metadata (like quantization and response time).  
- **No Database:** All chats are temporary and can be saved locally as JSON.
